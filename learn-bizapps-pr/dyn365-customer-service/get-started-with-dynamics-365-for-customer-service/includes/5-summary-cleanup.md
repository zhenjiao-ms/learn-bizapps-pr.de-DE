Letâ€™s do a quick review of what we covered in this first module.

We reviewed Customer Service from a holistic perspective, including common scenarios, such as addressing customer or product issues, answering customer questions, and collecting and applying customer feedback. 

We reviewed how customers are likely to interact, including mobile devices, social media, looking for their own answers.

Finally, we looked at the core records that can be stored in Customer Service, including cases, activities, entitlements, knowledge base articles, queues, products, goals and KPIs, and service level agreements. 

## Next steps
In the next module, you'll get a chance to set up automated case management.
